We will focus on the times to complete the three elements of the triathlon, swimming (SwimTime), biking (BikeTime) and running (RunTime).  The units for each of these features is minutes.  The overall time (including transitions from on element to the next) is found in *OverallTime*. Create a scatterplot for *SwimTime* as a predictor for *RunTime*.\n",
