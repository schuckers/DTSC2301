    "## Bootstrapping\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a frequently used technique to generate inferential quantities, confidence intervals and p-values.  The exciting thing about the bootstrap is that it is very flexible and can be used in many, many circumstances since it makes fewer assumptions than other types of tests.  Formally the bootstrap is about understanding the sampling distribution of a statistic (like the mean or the standard deviation) and, in particularly, how much variability there is in the statistic due to the sampling process.  To get estimates of this variability, we will approximate the sampling process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps of the bootstrap: \n",
    "1. Define and calculate the statistic of interest\n",
    "2. Resample the data with replacement many times, calculate and store the statistic of interest each time\n",
    "3. Use the percentiles of the stored values to make inference"
